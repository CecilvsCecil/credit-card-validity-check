 
Credit card companies use built-in "checksums" as added security measures when creating the account numbers on credit cards. This means that there are only certain valid credit card numbers, and validity can instantly be detected by using an algorithm that may involve adding up parts of the numbers or performing other checks.  The algorithm used for this particular card checker is outlined below.

For a valid credit card number:  

	1.	The first digit must be a 4.  
	2.	The fourth digit must be one greater than the fifth digit  
	3.	The product of the first, fifth, and ninth digits must be 24  
	4.	The sum of all digits must be evenly divisible by 4  
	5.	The sum of the first four digits must be one less than the sum of the last four digits  
	6.	If you treat the first two digits as a two-digit number, and the seventh and eight digits as a two digit number, their sum must be 100.  

valid card numbers according to this set of rules include 4807-6052-1766 and 4094-3460-2754.
